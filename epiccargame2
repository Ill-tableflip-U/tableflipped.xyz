Epic Car Game 2






Epic car game 2 is a time trial racing game that allows you to drive a drifting tesla around a racetrack. You must make it around the map once without taking any shortcuts. The controls for this game are WASD/arrow keys to move, R to flip the vehicle and 1,2 and 3 to change the camera view. On camera 1, you may also use the left click drag to drag the camera. There is a comprehensive anti-cheat system in this game that stops you from crossing the finish line if you haven’t gone around the whole course. To start, click the start button and wait to be able to move, then race! After you finish, you will be shown your time and high score with the option to race again. Just don’t drift that tesla too much or mr. Musk won’t be happy!
