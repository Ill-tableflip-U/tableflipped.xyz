Welcome to gold scavenger! An experimental space station exploded, leaving gold raining down on this area. You have to collect as much as possible! 
 However, other people have the same idea and are camping out on the road to grab as much as possible, so don't run over them, Or your car will no longer be suitable to drive. Try to get as rich as possible before it is all taken! 
 You can go off the road, but that means you get a lower score.
You can control the car using the left and right arrow keys.
